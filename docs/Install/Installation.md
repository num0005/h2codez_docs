In order to install H2Codez the user will need 2 things. You will need to acquire two things.

1. Halo 2 Vista Game DVD\ISO – You will need this since the original game install is the only thing that provides the installer for the map editor. How you go about acquiring this is up to you.
2. The H2Codez Launcher – This can be downloaded from the [H2Codez Launcher Github Page](https://github.com/Project-Cartographer/H2-Toolkit-Launcher) or from the [direct link here.](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/num0005/h2-toolkit-launcher/artifacts/Launcher/bin/Release/H2CodezLauncher.exe)
		
After you've got both of these items go ahead and install the map editor through your Halo 2 Vista game ISO. Do not update your map editor after you have installed it. 
H2Codez is only made to run on the first released version of the map editor. Updating it for newer versions of the editor would be too time consuming for little reward at this point in time. 
Now download the H2Codez launcher and place it in the root directory of the map editor folder. Run it and let it do it's thing. Once it tells you the update is done then you should be good to go.
