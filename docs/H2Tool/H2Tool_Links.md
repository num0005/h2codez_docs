H2Tool uses a text file format named JMS or ASS in order to produce the many models used for our levels and objects. A pack containing various scripts for both Blender and 3DS Max can be found in the link below. Also included is a readme that will go over what the file is intended to do.

The H2Codez launcher is a program made by Num005 in order to automatically update the H2Codez DLL and easily add H2Codez features to a user friendly UI. Requires the first released version of the map editor tools in order to patch the exes to automatically load H2Codez.

Notepad++ is a more in-depth editor for text documents. We will be using this to create and edit JMS files so make sure to have this on hand.

Due to the lack of an exporter for JMSV2(Halo 2 Specific JMS files) you will need a template for manually creating these files until an exporter is made.
