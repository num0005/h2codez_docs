Collision tags in Halo 2 are created by exporting JMS files in UTF-16 format and making some specific changes to how the material and node names are done. We can then import the JMS file with H2Tool to get our working collision_model tags.
Let's get started by making the necessary changes to a freshly exported JMS file from either Blender or 3DS Max.
